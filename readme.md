# Stockmarket-simulator

Multi-threaded JavaFX desktop app that simulates the behavior of investors and stock markets.

The UX was designed and developed by me with the use of JavaFX Scene Builder.

Some screenshots from the app can be found below:

1. The overview screen displays some information about the current state of simulation. 
This section is further divided into tabs. In order to show more info 
on specific object double-click it on the list.

2. Add - use it if you want to add objects to the simulation manually.

3. Simulation - that's where you can start a new simulation, 
save current state of simulation or load another one. Also, 
you can add more objects to the simulation really quick here. 
Just select the type of object you want to add and provide proper quantity.
